## Introduction
This repo forms the submittal for the final project of ECEP 590 - Software Engineering for Embedded applications offered as part of the Professional Masters Program in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington.

## Project Goals
This project will, using the robot state machine from the [week 8 homework](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520/tree/master/week_7 "ECEP520 Week 8"), create a more realistic simulation of a security patrol robot.

This will be done using the [ELMA](http://klavinslab.org/elma/ "Elma Main Page") event loop and process manager that was developed during the ECEP 590 Winter class at the University of Washington and the code produced for the [week 8 homework](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520/tree/master/week_7 "ECEP520 Week 8").




## Milestones
[ ] Create directory structure, docker container for the project, complile using robot state machine example from [week 8 homework](https://github.com/klavins/ECEP520/tree/master/week_7 "ECEP520 Week 8").

[ ] Simulate the on board batteries including realistic battery loading based upon the activity and a charge cycle with a typical recharge curve.

[ ] Allow the patrol robot to report position and status to a remote server at regular intervals as well as during events of interest.

[ ] Create set patrol patterns that can be simulated, with differet terrain.

[ ] Extend robot and patrol code to react automatically to simulated obstacles and intruders.

[ ] Create a simulated user control panel that would allow, for instance, deactivation of alarms, cancelling of patrols, force battery charging, chage patrol route, etc...
